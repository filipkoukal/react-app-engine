                Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an
                enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be
                broken by Love&apos;s first kiss. She was locked away in a
                castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave
                knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but
                none prevailed. She waited in the dragon&apos;s keep in the
                highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true
                love&apos;s first kiss. Like that&apos;s ever going to happen.
                What a loony. Shrek Beware Stay out I think he&apos;s in here.
                All right. Lets get it! Hold on. Do you know what that thing can
                do to you? Yeah. He&apos;ll groan into your bones for his
                brains. Well actually that would be a giant. Now Ogres, huh,
                they are much worse.

                They&apos;ll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin.

                And be quiet! This cage is so small. You wouldn&apos;t turn me

                You boneheaded donkey! That&apos;s it. I have heard enough.
                Guards! No, no, he talks, he does! I can talk. I love to talk.
                I&apos;ve talked to... Get her out of my sight! -No, no, I
                swear! Hey, I can fly. -He can fly! -He can fly! He can talk!
                -That&apos;s right, fool! Now I&apos;m a flying, talking donkey!
                You might have seen house fly, maybe even a superfly. But I bet
                you ain&apos;t never seen a donkey fly! Seize him! Get him! This
                way! Hurry! You there. Ogre. -I. By the order of lord Farquaad.
                I am authorized to place you both under arrest. And transport
                you to designated resettlement facility. Oh really? You and what
                army? Can I say something to you? Listen, you were really,
                really something, back there. Incredible. Are you talking to...
                ...me? Yes, I was talking to you. Can I just tell you that you
                were really great back there with those guards. They thought
                that was all over there. And then you showed up and BAM. There
                was tripping on over themselves like babes in the woods. That
                really made me feel good to see that. Oh, that&apos;s great.
                Really. Man, it&apos;s good to be free. Now, why don&apos;t you
                go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? But I... I
                don&apos;t have any friends. And I&apos;m not going out there by
                myself. Hey wait a minute. I have a great idea... I&apos;ll
                stick with you.

                You and me in green fighting machine. Together we&apos;ll scare
                the spin if anybody crosses us. Oh, a, that was really scary.
                Maybe you don&apos;t mine me saying. If that don&apos;t work,
                your breath will certainly do the job done, &apos;cause... you
                definitively need some tic-tac or something, &apos;cause your
                breath stinks! Man you&apos;ve ??? my note! Just like the
                time... ...and then I ate some rotten berries. Man I had some
                strong gases leaking out of my but that day. Why are you
                following me? I&apos;ll tell you why. &apos;Cause I&apos;m all
                alone, there is no one here, beside me. My problems have all
                gone. There&apos;s no one to derive me. But you got to have free
                ... -Stop singing! Well, it&apos;s no wonder, you don&apos;t
                have any friends. Wow! Only a true friend would be that truly
                honest. Listen! Little donkey. Take a look at me! What am I?
                A... ...really tall? No! I&apos;m an Ogre. You know, grab your
                torch and pitchforks. Doesn&apos;t that bother you? Nope.
                Really? -Really really. Oh? Man, I like you. What&apos;s your
                name? A..., Shrek. Shrek?! But do you know, what I like about
                you, Shrek? You&apos;ve got that kind of: &quot;I don&apos;t
                care what nobody thinks of me&quot; thing. I like that, I

                Uh, look at that. Who would wanna live in a place like that?
                That would be my home. Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful. You
                know you&apos;re quite a decorator. It&apos;s amazing what you
                did with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a
                nice boulder. I guess, you don&apos;t entertain much, do you? I
                like my privacy. You know I do to. That&apos;s another thing, we
                have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your
                face. You try to give them a hint and they won&apos;t leave. And
                then there&apos;s that big occurred silence, you know? Can I
                stay with you? -What? Can I stay with you, please. Of course!
                -Really? No. -Please! I don&apos;t want to go back there. You
                don&apos;t how is like to be concerned like a freak. Well...,
                maybe you do. But that&apos;s why we have to stick together! You
                got to let me stay! Please! Please! OK, OK. -But one night only.
                -Huh, thank you! A, what are you do... No! This is going to be
                fun. We can stay up late, swap the manly stories. And in the
                morning... I&apos;m making waffles. Where do I sleep? Outside!
                Oh, a, I guess that&apos;s cool. You know, I don&apos;t know you
                and you don&apos;t know me... ... so I guess, outside is best
                for me. Here I go. Good night. I do like that half door.
                I&apos;m a donkey all alone outside. Sit by myself outside, I
                guess. I&apos;m all alone, there&apos;s no one here beside me.
                -I thought, I told you to stay outside. -I am outside. Well
                James. This is far from the farm, but what choice do we have?
                It&apos;s not... What a lovely bed. -Got you! I found some
                cheese.
